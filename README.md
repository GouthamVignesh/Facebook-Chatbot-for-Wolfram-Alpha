# Facebook-Chatbot-for-Wolfram-Alpha
This is a Facebook Chatbot which replies to the user's generic query by searching and retrieving the results from the Wolfram Alpha Search Engine.


Built a Facebook Chatbot using Wolfram API within 24 hours at a Hackathon. The Chatbot can answer to user’s questions on a Facebook page. The chat box will take user’s query as input, and retrieve the results in JSON format by passing the query to the Wolfram Alpha search engine. The results are then displayed in the chat window to the user.
